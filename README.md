# 480AirportProject

The code for MiniMax is provided from Chapter 8. You can also use the example of Tic Tac Toe from that chapter as a strong starting point. You will need to implement a special subclass of Board that implements the numerical variant. You can play against the AI by running python3 ntictactoe_ai.py or run the unit tests as usual in test_ntictactoe.py.

## Setup
1. Install Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download)
2. Set up a virtual environment in Pycharm using Anaconda. The Python version for this environment must be 2.7
3. Click Install Dependencies, which should automatically install pandas, matplotlib, etc. If not, these may need to manually be selected in the Anaconda Navigator.
4. Run the frontend_wx.py file in Pycharm. 
5. The GUI should then open and allow the user to enter or select the desired start and end airports.
6. Rather than running frontend_wx.py, you can also run a test by running the main function in porthop.py, which uses the two airports BTV and LNZ.
